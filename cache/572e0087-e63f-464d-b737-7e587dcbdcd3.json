{"includedIn":[],"title":"The Sound Of Music","slug":"the-sound-of-music","synopsis":"\"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\" Well, it seems the best thing to do with musical nun Julie Andrews is to sling her a guitar, deck her out in a natty apron and put her in charge of seven children belonging to a widowed naval captain (Christopher Plummer). Telling the true story of the Von Trapp family's flight from the Nazis in wartime Austria, Rodgers & Hammerstein's evergreen classic thrums along to some of the most hummable tunes ever written. With five Oscars and a songlist that includes Edelweiss, My Favourite Things and Do-Re-Mi, the hills couldn't be more alive if they tried.","shortSynopsis":"Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, starring Julie Andrews.","mediumSynopsis":"Unruly nun Julie Andrews joins widower Christopher Plummer and his seven children as they flee from the Nazis.
