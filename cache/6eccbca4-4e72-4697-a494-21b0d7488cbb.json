{"includedIn":[],"title":"A Clockwork Orange","slug":"a-clockwork-orange","synopsis":"Set in a dystopian future, Stanley Kubrick's controversial adaptation of Anthony Burgess's satirical novel stars Malcolm McDowell as a young thug whose propensity for ultraviolence is tempered by a revolutionary form of mind control. Though framed as a black comedy, Kubrick doesn't shy from the rape, viciousness or Droogspeak. Such was the critical backlash in Britain that Kubrick withdrew all broadcast rights; the film has only been legally watchable here since his death. Disturbing and compelling, you can see what all the fuss was about - a rape, to the strains of Singin' in the Rain, hasn't lost its power to shock and offend. Stereo sound only.","shortSynopsis":"Controversial classic about an off-the-wall gang who embark on a violent crime spree.","mediumSynopsis":"Controversial classic about an off-the-wall gang who embark on a violent crime spree.","guidanceText":"flashing images, strong language, mature themes, sex, violence","actors":[{"name":"Patrick Magee","slug":"patrick-magee","rel":"person","id":"94056aa8-f5ae-4d1b-970e-ea863c27b904","links":[{"rel":"search","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/catalog/assets/search/advanced/patrick-magee?actor=Patrick+Magee","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":false},{"rel":"person","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/catalog/assets/actor/94056aa8-f5ae-4d1b-970e-ea863c27b904/patrick-magee","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":false}]}],"directors":[{"name":"Stanley Kubrick","slug":"stanley-kubrick","rel":"person","id":"2ffcc907-8e83-4285-83cf-3310d1f83a7e","links":[{"rel":"search","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/catalog/assets/search/advanced/stanley-kubrick?director=Stanley+Kubrick","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":false},{"rel":"person","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/catalog/assets/director/2ffcc907-8e83-4285-83cf-3310d1f83a7e/stanley-kubrick","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":false}]}],"ratings":[{"title":"18","rel":"rating","id":"0ab33196-6870-4665-b996-836e7e4a3c63","links":[{"rel":"image","href":"https://images.store.sky.com/api/img/direct/328B4E21-5B2B-4670-9B9E-CA039AE9D472_0AB33196-6870-4665-B996-836E7E4A3C63_2008122181446.jpeg","needsAuthentication":false}]}],"duration":130,"year":1971,"dvdReleaseDate":"1972-01-13T00:00:00Z","countries":[],"genres":[{"label":"Drama","rel":"genre","slug":"drama","id":"eab19ddb-a225-425a-8423-ed9986431b69","links":[{"rel":"genre","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/catalog/assets/genre/eab19ddb-a225-425a-8423-ed9986431b69/drama","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":false}]}],"rel":"asset","lastUpdateDate":"2017-03-04T06:00:03.317Z","assetType":"Programme","catalogSection":"Movies","id":"6eccbca4-4e72-4697-a494-21b0d7488cbb","links":[{"rel":"image","href":"https://images.store.sky.com/api/img/asset/en/66D8BB8A-E4E8-4422-9242-603110084545_0A8FFCDF-5105-43E1-B0CA-59BFF6E20486_2017-2-15-T11-44-35.jpg?s={{w}}x{{h}}","needsAuthentication":false},{"rel":"backgroundImage","href":"https://images.store.sky.com/api/img/assetbackground/en/D26F51A8-7BCA-4B9F-987D-5397C85662C5_0A8FFCDF-5105-43E1-B0CA-59BFF6E20486_2017-2-15-T11-44-35.jpg?s={{w}}x{{h}}","needsAuthentication":false},{"rel":"favorite","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/user/assets/6eccbca4-4e72-4697-a494-21b0d7488cbb/favorites/a-clockwork-orange","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":true},{"rel":"entitlement","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/user/assets/6eccbca4-4e72-4697-a494-21b0d7488cbb/entitlements/a-clockwork-orange","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":true},{"rel":"userOptions","href":"https://www.skystore.com/api/web/v2/user/assets/6eccbca4-4e72-4697-a494-21b0d7488cbb/options/a-clockwork-orange","method":"GET","needsAuthentication":true}]}
