{"includedIn":[],"title":"Dial M For Murder","slug":"dial-m-for-murder","synopsis":"Never did Hitchcock deserve the title 'Master of Suspense' more than with this nail-biting tale of a scheming playboy (Ray Milland) plotting to do away with his blameless wife (Grace Kelly). Hitch keeps everyone on the hook throughout, though Milland's rotter seems to take every twist in his stride. Originally filmed in 3D, the film was remade twice; first with Christopher Plummer and Angie Dickinson, then later with Michael Douglas and a pre-stardom Gwyneth Paltrow. Inevitably, neither comes close to matching Hitch for sheer deviousness.","shortSynopsis":"Ray Milland gets a pal to bump off wife Grace Kelly, but it doesn't all go according to plan.
