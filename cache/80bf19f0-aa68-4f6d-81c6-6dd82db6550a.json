{"includedIn":[],"title":"The Crucible","slug":"the-crucible","synopsis":"Arthur Miller's McCarthyite allegory chronicles the infamous Salem witch trials.  Set in 1692, the timeless tragedy opens with a teenage girl drinking a charm to kill her former lover's wife. The New England village is soon convulsed by accusations of witchcraft, but spite and superstition are at work - not the supernatural. Miller (in his role as screenwriter) and director Nicholas Hytner (maker of The Madness of King George) supervise a superlative cast. Winona Ryder is chillingly malevolent as the girl whose guilty desires unleash the terror, and Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are moving as the wronged husband and wife","shortSynopsis":"Period drama, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.","mediumSynopsis":"Adaptation of Arthur Miller's play about the infamous 17th-century Salem witch hysteria.
